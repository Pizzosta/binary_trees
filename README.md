# Binary Trees

A binary tree is a data structure in which each parent bode can have at most two children. Each node of a BT consists of three items: `data`, `address of left child`, and `address of right child`.
In this project, we will be implementing BTs in various tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
